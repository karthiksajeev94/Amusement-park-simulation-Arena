Simulation model of the transportation system for ferrying visitors within an amusement park

The study focused on comparing two different bus routing models by varying the number of buses, their capacities and the ride times.

The goal was to maximize the number of rides each visitor gets to take and minimize the queue length as well as the time to exit the park after closing.
